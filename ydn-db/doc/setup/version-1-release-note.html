description: "YDN-DB Version 1 release node for ydn-db"
title: "Version 1 release note"
introduction: "Release version 1 means that the API, as it states (or intention) is stable and ready for production use. Bug will be fixed without breaking the API  for at least two years, probably a lot longer. Some modules development will be continued and will still be enhanced the API without breaking."

    <p>
      I have been developing and using javascript database library (YDN-DB) for
      nearly three years and now it is time to release. This is the time with multiple reasons. </p>
    <p>
      First of all, I like <a title="YDN-DB API" href="http://dev.yathit.com/api/ydn/db/storage.html">the
      API</a> a lot. There are few I want to change,
      but I cannot figure out significantly better alternative. As you can see,
      API is very simple. Just instantiate the main class (<code>ydn.db.Storage</code>)
      and start using right aways. It works on all browsers and mobile clients.
      API is very concise, meaning you don't need to learn much, but use right aways. Expected
      methods like <code>add</code>, <code>get</code>, <code>put</code> and <code>clear</code>
      are there and works as expected. </p>
    <p>
      At the same time, the API is very flexible and powerfull enough on very
      complex situation requiring transactions and multiple nested queries. I have
      being using the library to many large scale projects. Many other people
      are also using my library for large scale projects. </p>
    <p>
      Performance is considered from the ground up as
      well as every piece of implementation. There is no caching to make it run
      faster. High performance is archived by using parallelization of database
      executions and using raw browser API as much as possible. </p>
    <p>
      I apologize that my library is not working perfectly on some browsers like
      IE and on mobiles. The library works well on Chrome and Firefox. The main
      reason is that other browsers do not yet follow IndexedDB API
      specification. They can be polyfilled, but does so require a lot of
      testing and implementation. These missing API are for advanced use cases
      (multiEntry, compound index), but they are not easy to implement. So I
      will just wait, rather than trying to polyfill them. </p>
    <p>
      Event module is incomplete. Implementing event is
      hard and also there is performance penalty. The use case are often, more of
      convenient than essential. IndexedDB API v2 is likely to have native
      support for Event. So, event module implementation need to wait and I may
      not fix bugs on this module. </p>
    <h3>
      Version 2 is coming </h3>
    <p>
      Version 2 API focus on robustness, trading over ease of use. It is not
      backward compatible. Only IndexedDB will be supported and use native
      object like <code><a href="http://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#promises">Promise</a></code>, <code>
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/#range-concept">IDKeyRange</a></code> and <code>
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/#cursor-concept">IDBCussor</a></code>.
      It will be less reliance on <a href="https://developers.google.com/closure/library/">closure library</a> or
      possibly not using it at all. </p>
    <p>I have proposed few API methods to W3 web app working group on <a href="https://www.w3.org/2008/webapps/wiki/IndexedDatabaseFeatures">
      IndexedDB API v2 specification</a>. Most of these API methods are required for efficient key joining and query
      optimizations. The proposed methods are very likely to appear on v2. Of course, YDN-DB will be the first to support them
      and will be back port to v1 as well.</p>
    <p>
      Main concept like schema, <a href="/ydn-db/doc/usage/transaction.html">transaction thread</a> and iterator style query will be
      carried forward. Most of the implementation will be focused on <a href="/ydn-db/doc/query/sql-query.html">SQL
      execution</a>. <a href="/ydn-db/doc/sync/index.html">Synchronization</a> with backend services and
      <a href="https://github.com/yathit/ydn-db-fulltext">full text search</a> will
      work out of the box. </p>
    <p>
      Another main reason is, W3 web app working group has published release
      candidate for <a title="Indexed Database API" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB">IndexedDB
      API v1</a> several months ago with consensus agreement with browser
      vendor except Apple. So I hope all browsers will implement IndexedDB API
      with strict compatibility. </p>
    <p>
      Last reason is that today is my last day of work at National University of
      Singapore. </p>
