### NoSQL query demo app

This app demonstrates how to make complex query using compound index, multiEntry and key joining. It is also design to analyse query performance. It also illustrates efficient paging strategy.

NOTE: This app use older API and no longer maintained. I plan to rewrite using newer query module.
