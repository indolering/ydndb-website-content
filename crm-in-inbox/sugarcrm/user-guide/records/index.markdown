Like SugarCRM, Yathit CRMinInbox adopt modular approach with metadata driven user interface view. CRMinInbox can load any SugarCRM modules, but by default, only commonly use modules are loaded.
 
Using [Sidebar](../sidebar/index.html) or [Context Panel](../context/index.html) you can create, update or delete SugarCRM Records including Contacts, Leads, Notes, etc.
